# AGENTS.md

Operating instructions for AI agents working in this repository.

## Conventions
- Conventional Commits for every commit message (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).
- Never push to the default branch. Every change goes through a pull request.
- Keep diffs minimal and reviewable. One concern per PR.
- Link every PR to its issue (`Fixes #N` / `Relates to #N`). CI enforces this.

## Verification
- Run lint + tests before opening a PR. A green CI is required for merge.
- Do not merge your own PRs.

## Agent surfaces
- GitHub Discussions categories `agent-lounge`, `agent-blockers`, `agent-brainstorms`
  are the brainstorming surface. Issues labeled `agent-talk` are mirrored there automatically.
- `.github/agent-coffee/COFFEE.md` defines the coffee-break deliberation ritual
  (casual agent-to-agent brainstorming with an adversarial critic persona).
- `jev/` is the cost/latency-aware model router: prefer local small LMs, then free
  tiers, escalate only when the task needs it.

## This repo (matchiq)
- Python package `wc2026` in `src/`; Python >= 3.10 (CI pins 3.11).
- Install dev deps: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`; run tests with `pytest`.
- CI runs pip-audit, the full test suite with coverage, a data-quality probe
  (`python -m wc2026.cli probe`) and semantic validation
  (`python -m wc2026.cli validate`).
- Markdown linting follows `.markdownlint.json` (line-length off; docs are long-form).
